# node-red-contrib-mssql-plus

A [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) node to execute queries, stored procedures and bulk inserts in Microsoft SQL Server and Azure Databases SQL2000 ~ SQL2019.

Importantly, this package comes with pre-built linux drivers for communicating with the Azure & MS SQL services (using TDS protocol), removing the need to set-up environment level MSSQL (or similar) drivers.

## Features include...
* Connect to multiple SQL Servers and Azure databases from SQL2000 ~ 2019
* Perform multiple queries in one go & get back multiple recordsets (depends on the queries sent)
* Supports Stored Procedure execute
* Supports Bulk Insert
* Built in examples (node-red hamburger menu → import → examples → node-red-contrib-mssql-plus)
  * TVP - A demo of calling a stored procedure and passing in a table valued parameters
  * BULK - A demo of inserting a large amount of data in bulk mode
* Use env vars in the config node for all fields (including credentials). e.g...
  * Server `{{{SQL_IP}}}`
  * Password `{{{SQL_PW}}}`
* Use mustache in your SQL queries including msg, flow and global context. e.g...
  * `SELECT TOP {{{payload.maxRows}}} * FROM [MyTable] WHERE Name = '{{{flow.name}}}' AND quantity <= {{{global.maxQty}}}`
  * View the final query (mustache rendered into values) in `msg.query` to understanding what happened to your {{{mustache}}} parameters 
* Enter parameters in the UI or send parameters in via `msg`, `flow` or `global` variables for use in your SQL queries e.g...
  * `SELECT * FROM [MyTable] WHERE Name = @name AND quantity <= @maxQty`
  * View the final parameters (rendered with final values) in `msg.queryParams` that were used in the query to aid debugging 
  * View output parameters values in `msg.queryParams` after the query has executed 
* Choose between throwing an error to the catch node or outputting an error property in `msg.error`
* Additional properties are in the msg object (use a debug node with "complete msg object" set to see whats available)

## Install

### Easiest

Use the Manage Palette > Install option from the menu inside node-red

### Harder

Alternatively in your Node-RED user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-mssql-plus
```

## Usage
Please refer to the built in help in the info panel in node red.

## Sample flow
Demonstrating mustache rendering, input parameters, mutliple queries, print info... 
* Payload: `{"count": 5, "age": 35}`
* Parameters
  * `name`, `varchar(20)`, `stephen`
  * `age`, `int`, `msg.payload.age`
* Query:   
```
      PRINT @name
      SELECT TOP {{{payload.count}}} * 
      FROM testdb.dbo.[MyTable] WHERE Name = @name
      SELECT TOP {{{payload.count}}} * 
      FROM testdb.dbo.[MyTable] WHERE Age = @age
      PRINT 'complete'
```
* After Rendering Mustache: 
```
      PRINT @name
      SELECT TOP 5 * 
      FROM testdb.dbo.[MyTable] WHERE Name = @name
      SELECT TOP 5 * 
      FROM testdb.dbo.[MyTable] WHERE Age = @age
      PRINT 'complete'
```
